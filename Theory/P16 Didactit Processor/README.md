## Operating modes

The P16 processor supports two distinct operating modes:

- **Normal Mode (N)**, used for normal program execution;

- **Interrupt Mode (I)**, used to process external interrupt requests.

Both modes provide access to all system resources and allow you to switch mode of operation.
The change of operating mode can be done by software or result from an exception:

- Reset;
- Interrupt Request (IRQ)

## Registers

The P16 processor provides the programmer with a total of 19 registers, all 16-bit:
- 16 general-purpose records;
-  2 processor status records (CPSR and SPSR).

The records that can be accessed are defined by the Processor operating mode

### General use registers

The 16 general-purpose records are divided into two blocks of 8 records:
- The low block contains records R0 to R7;
- The high block contains records R8 through R15.

The low block registers are of generic use and accessible by any instruction that have a record as either a source or destination operand.
High block registers cannot be used as the first source operand of the Instructions.
Some registers of the high block are in generic use - R9 to R12, but three are committed tospecific functionalities: R13, R14, R15

### Special use register

- **R15** - maps the **Program Counter (PC)**, saving, at all times, the address of memory where the code of the next instruction to be executed is
- **R14** - is used as a **Link Register (LR)** to store the return address in calls to subroutines or on the input in Break mode.
- **R13** -  is used as a **Stack Pointer (SP)** for stack manipulation instructions.

### Processor state registers

The P16 processor has two status records:
- **Current Processor Status Register (CPSR)**, which stores the current state of the processor;
- **Saved Processor Status Register (SPSR)**, to save the CPSR value at the moment 
immediately prior to entering Interrupt mode.

**CPSR** and **SPSR** are accessible in both operating modes, but using its own instructions.

Both are 16-bit registers, where only bits 0 through 5 have meaning:

|      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | M    | I    | N    | V    | C    | Z    |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 15   |      |      |      |      |      |      |      |      | 6    | 5    | 4    | 3    | 2    | 1    | 0    |

Meaning of CPSR/SPSR bits:

- **Z** - takes the value ```one``` when the value resulting from performing a logical operation or arithmetic is zero;
- **C** - takes the value ```one``` when performing an arithmetic operation results transport to the most significant digit, or in the operations of displacement o last bit shifted is 1;
- **V** - takes the value ```one``` when, when performing a subtraction or a sum, the result exceeds the domain, understood as integers with a code sign of the add-ons for two;
- **N** - takes the logical value of the highest weight bit of the result after performing a arithmetic or logical operation;
- **I** - enables the handling of external interruptions;
- **M** - sets the operating mode of the processor

## Instruction set

The P16 processor instruction set comprises 43 distinct instructions.

The instructions are organized into 3 classes:

- Data processing instructions;

- Control instructions;

- Data transfer instructions.

The data processing instructions adopt a format with three operands.
All instructions are encoded with 16 bits.



### Data processing instructions

The data processing instructions perform operations involving the registers of general and constant use.
There are six subclasses of data processing instructions:

- Arithmetic instructions (add, sub, adc, sbc);
- Comparison instructions (cmp);
- Constant loading instructions (mov, movt);
- Instructions for copying data between registers (mov, movn);
- Logical instructions (and, orr, eor);
- Shifting instructions(lsl, lsr, asr, ror, rol, rrx, rlx).

Most data processing instructions also update the bits of status in the CPSR, depending on the calculated result.

RRX R5, R4 			; R5(15)=Cy, R5(14..0)=R4(15..1), Cy=R4(0)
```



### Control instructions

The control instructions allow you to change the execution flow of the programs by changing the CP value.
Typically, there are three types of control instructions:

- Unconditional jumping (b);
- Conditional jump (beq/bzs, bne/bzc, blo/bcc, bhs/bcs, bge, blt);
- Jump with linkage.

On the P16, all jump instructions set the jump address relative to the PC, this allows space saving when coding instructions and also allows programs to be relocatable.
The value to add to the PC is specified using a constant, encoded with 11 bits using the add-on code. 

> The range of jumps is limited to the range [-512; +511] instructions.

#### For natural numbers

| Testing condition   | Comparison instruction | Jump instruction |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| ```if ( a == b )``` | ```CMP R0, R1```       | ```BNE if_end``` |
| ```if ( a != b )``` | ```CMP R0, R1```       | ```BEQ if_end``` |
| ```if ( a < b )```  | ```CMP R0, R1```       | ```BHS if_end``` |
| ```if ( a <= b )``` | ```CMP R1, R0```       | ```BLO if_end``` |
| ```if ( a > b )```  | ```CMP R1, R0```       | ```BHS if_end``` |
| ```if ( a >= b )``` | ```CMP R0, R1```       | ```BLO if_end``` |



#### For signal integers

| Testing condition   | Comparison instruction | Jump instruction |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| ```if ( a == b )``` | ```CMP R0, R1```       | ```BNE if_end``` |
| ```if ( a != b )``` | ```CMP R0, R1```       | ```BEQ if_end``` |
| ```if ( a < b )```  | ```CMP R0, R1```       | ```BGE if_end``` |
| ```if ( a <= b )``` | ```CMP R1, R0```       | ```BLT if_end``` |
| ```if ( a > b )```  | ```CMP R1, R0```       | ```BGE if_end``` |
| ```if ( a >= b )``` | ```CMP R0, R1```       | ```BLT if_end``` |



### Data transfer instructions

The address space of the P16 is 64 KB, byte and word addressable (16-bit dimension) with 16-bit word alignment.

Data is organized according to *little-endian* format.

Single address space for code access, data and I/O ports.

The instructions for transferring data with memory are of the register-memory type.

There are two classes of data transfer instructions with memory:

- **Load**, for copying the data contained in memory bins to the register file
- **Store**, for copying the contents of registers in the register file to memory locations.

The P16 supports two addressing modes to set the effective address of the memory position to be accessed:

- **Indexed addressing**
  - The base value can be obtained from a register in the low block of the register file (R0 - R7);
  - The index value can be retrieved from any register in the register file or defined using a constant.
- **Relative addressing**
  - The CP value is used as a baseline;
  - The value of the index is defined by a constant.
  - The constants used as an index are natural numbers



| **Instruction**         | Notes                                                        |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ldr Rd, label           | Copies a word from memory to the Rd register. The effective address of the memory accessed is specified by the label symbol with a max distance of +128 Bytes. |
| pop Rd                  | Copies from stack to register Rd                             |
| push Rs                 | Copies to stack the value of register Rd                     |
| ldr Rd, [Rn, \<imm4\>]  | Copies a word from memory to the Rd register. The effective memory address accessed is obtained by adding the value of the constant imm4 (index) to the contents of the Rn register (base) |
| ldrb Rd, [Rn, \<imm3\>] | Copies one byte from memory to the Rd register. The effective address of the memory position is obtained by adding the value of the constant imm3 (index) to the contents of the Rn (base) register. The read value is extended, unsigned, to 16 bits. |
| ldr Rd, [Rn, Rm]        | Copies a word from memory to the Rd register. The effective memory address accessed is obtained by adding the contents of the Rm register (index) to the contents of the Rn register (base). |
| ldrb Rd, [Rn, Rm]       | Copies one byte from memory to the Rd register. The effective address of the memory position is obtained by adding the contents of the Rm register (index) to the contents of the Rn register (base). The read value is extended, unsigned, to 16 bits. |
| str Rs, [Rn, \<imm4\>]  | Copies the contents of the Rs register to a memory location. The actual address of that memory position is obtained by adding the value of an imm4 constant (index) to the contents of the Rn (base) register. |
| strb Rs, [Rn, \<imm3\>] | Copies the least significant byte from the contents of the Rs register to a memory position. The effective address of this memory position is obtained by adding to the value of the register Rd (base) with the constant imm3 (index) multiplied by two. |
| str Rs, [Rn, Rm]        | Copies the contents of the Rs registry to a memory location. The actual address of this memory position is obtained by adding the contents of the Rm register (index) to the contents of the of the Rn register (base) |
| strb Rs, [Rn, Rm]       | Copies the least significant byte from the contents of the Rs register to a memory position. The effective address of this memory position is obtained by summing the contents from the Rm register (index) to the contents of the Rn register (base). |
