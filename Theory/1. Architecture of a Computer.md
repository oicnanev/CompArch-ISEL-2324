# 1. Architecture of a Computer



## Computer classes



**Computer definition** - digital system programmable through a sequence of instructions, which is used to obtain, process and store data.



**Computer types:**

- Personal computers
- Servers
- Embedded systems



## Organization of a Computer



The internal organization of a computer comprises 3 subsystems:

- Processor or Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- Main Memory subsystem
- Data Input and Output (I/O) subsystem



### Processor



The Processor is responsible for processing the instructions stored in memory.

To this end, its internal structure is based on:

- Processing Unit
- Control Unit



#### Processing Unit

Is composed essentially by:

- **Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)** - supports the performance of the calculations necessary for the execution of the instructions
- **Register File** - stores the operands and results of those calculations 

##### Arithmetic and Logic Unit

- Circuit that performs arithmetic and logic operations generating a set of state bits relative to the calculated result.
- The number, type and complexity of these operations depends on the class of problems in view for the processor.
- Usually, an ULA is implemented using logic purely combinatorial.

##### Register File

- In a digital system, records are the elements that store the data to be processed.
- On a processing unit, the generic usage registers are grouped together in a block called register file.
- The number of registers that make up the register file is set to address the class of problems in view of a given processor.
- Typically:
  - The number of registers is a power of 2; 
  - Each record is referenced by a number.



#### Control Unit

The Control Unit is responsible for the management of the Processor functionality:

- Generate the word / sequence of control *words* that that define the intended functionality for each instruction
- Interaction with main memory and peripherals.

These control words define, among other things:

- The operation to be carried by the ALU
- The registers and constants that serve as operands
- The signals for forwarding data
- Etc.

The control unit receives the status bits from the ALU of the processing unit.
This information makes it possible for the sequences of operations generated by the control unit be dependent on the outcome of other operations, making possible to control the flow of a program execution.



### Memory

The memory subsystem can include one or more memory devices, with different characteristics (e.g. volatile, non-volatile, etc.)

This subsystem is connected to the processor via three buses:

- Address bus
- Data bus
- Control bus

The memory can be RAM (SRAM, DRAM), ROM (PROM, EPROM), NVRAM, Flash or EEPROM:

- RAM - Random-access Memory
  - SRAM - Static Random-access Memory
  - DRAM -Dynamic Random-access Memory
- ROM - Read-only Memory
  - PROM - Programmable Read-only Memory
  - EPROM - Erasable Programmable Read-only Memory
- NVRAM - Non-volatile Random-access Memory
- Flash
- EEPROM - Electronic-erasable Programmable Read-only Memory



### CISC and RISC concepts



#### CISC Processor

The CISC Stands for **Complex Instruction Set Computer**, developed by the Intel. It has a large collection of complex instructions that range from simple to very complex and specialized in the assembly language level, which takes a long time to execute the instructions. So, CISC approaches reducing the number of instruction on each program and ignoring the number of cycles per instruction. It emphasizes to build complex instructions directly in the hardware because the hardware is always faster than software. However, CISC chips are relatively slower as compared to RISC chips but use little instruction than RISC. Examples of CISC processors are VAX, AMD, Intel x86 and the System/360.



**Characteristics**:

- The length of the code is shorts, so it requires very little RAM
- CISC or complex instructions may take longer than a single clock cycle to execute the code
- Less instruction is needed to write an application
- It provides easier programming in assembly language
- Support for complex data structure and easy compilation of high-level languages
- It is composed of fewer registers and more addressing nodes, typically 5 to 20
- Instructions can be larger than a single word
- It emphasizes the building of instruction on hardware because it is faster to create than the software



**CISC Processor Architecture**

The CISC architecture helps reduce program code by embedding multiple operations on each program instruction, which makes the CISC processor more complex. The CISC architecture-based computer is designed to decrease memory costs because large programs or instruction required large memory space to store the data, thus increasing the memory requirement, and a large collection of memory increases the memory cost, which makes them more expensive.



**Advantages of CISC Processors**

- The compiler requires little effort to translate high-level programs or statement languages into assembly or machine language in CISC processors.
- The code length is quite short, which minimizes the memory requirement.
- To store the instruction on each CISC, it requires very less RAM.
- Execution of a single instruction requires several low-level tasks.
- CISC creates a process to manage power usage that adjusts clock speed and voltage.
- It uses fewer instructions set to perform the same instruction as the RISC.



**Disadvantages of CISC Processors**

- CISC chips are slower than RISC chips to execute per instruction cycle on each program.
- The performance of the machine decreases due to the slowness of the clock speed.
- Executing the pipeline in the CISC processor makes it complicated to use.
- The CISC chips require more transistors as compared to RISC design.
- In CISC it uses only 20% of existing instructions in a programming event.



#### RISC Processor

RISC stands for **Reduced Instruction Set Computer Processor**, a microprocessor architecture with a simple collection and highly customized set of instructions. It is built to minimize the instruction execution time by optimizing and limiting the number of instructions. It means each instruction cycle requires only one clock cycle, and each cycle contains three parameters: fetch, decode and execute. The RISC processor is also used to perform various complex instructions by combining them into simpler ones. RISC chips require several transistors, making it cheaper to design and reduce the execution time for instruction.Examples of RISC processors are SUN's SPARC, PowerPC, Microchip PIC processors, RISC-V.



**Advantages of RISC Processor**

- The RISC processor's performance is better due to the simple and limited number of the instruction set.
- It requires several transistors that make it cheaper to design.
- RISC allows the instruction to use free space on a microprocessor because of its simplicity.
- RISC processor is simpler than a CISC processor because of its simple and quick design, and it can complete its work in one clock cycle.



**Disadvantages of RISC Processor**

- The RISC processor's performance may vary according to the code executed because subsequent instructions may depend on the previous instruction for their execution in a cycle.
- Programmers and compilers often use complex instructions.
- RISC processors require very fast memory to save various instructions that require a large collection of cache memory to respond to the instruction in a short time.



**RISC Architecture**

It is a highly customized set of instructions used in portable devices due to system reliability such as Apple iPod, mobiles/smartphones, Nintendo DS, etc.



**Features of RISC Processor**

- **One cycle execution time:** For executing each instruction in a computer, the RISC processors require one CPI (Clock per cycle). And each CPI includes the fetch, decode and execute method applied in computer instruction.
- **Pipelining technique:** The pipelining technique is used in the RISC processors to execute multiple parts or stages of instructions to perform more efficiently.
- **A large number of registers:** RISC processors are optimized with multiple registers that can be used to store instruction and quickly respond to the computer and minimize interaction with computer memory.
- It supports a simple addressing mode and fixed length of instruction for executing the pipeline.
- It uses LOAD and STORE instruction to access the memory location.
- Simple and limited instruction reduces the execution time of a process in a RISC.

## Programming Model (ISA)

 

### Machine Code

Instructions are stored in memory in a format directly interpretable by the processor, that is, in machine language (machine code).
Every machine language instruction is made up of by a set of bits that specify, in a unambiguous, the operations to be carried out and the operands Involved.



### Stored Program concept

Instructions and program data are stored in memory as numbers.

- Advantage - running a different program consists of loading that program into memory, 
  instead of designing a new processor or defining new connections at the of the hardware.



In general, instructions are stored sequentially in memory and are executed in the order in which they are.

- Advantage - this order of execution can be changed by also using instructions, which creates support for controlling the flow of program execution.



### Fetch-Decode-Execute Cycle

The implementation of a program generally consists in the continuous performance of three operations per each Instruction stored in memory:

- Fetch instruction
- Decoding the instruction (decode)
- Execute the instruction

The **Program Counter** keeps the memory address of the next instruction to execute.

The **Instruction Register** keeps the code of the instructions that is being executed in the processor at all times.



### Assembly Language

The **assembly** language offers a higher level of abstraction to the programmer, although it is still very
close to machine language.

Each **assembly** statement corresponds to a statement of machine code which, however, is specified 
using mnemonics and symbolic names, rather than zeros and ones.

Using **assembly** language, the programmer can access all the features of the architecture.

Programming directly in machine language is a time-consuming task that requires a great effort of the programmers, because it is considered a very difficult and inefficient task to avoid.



### Instruction Set Architecture - ISA

Defines the programming model of a computer.

The model comprises:

- List of supported instructions (instruction set)
- Syntax of these instructions
- Supported operand types
  - Constants specified in the instructions themselves
  - Internal processor logs
  - Memory Locations
